# Book Store Web Application

Welcome to the Book Store Web Application! This is a Java-based platform built with Spring Boot, designed to manage a catalog of books and facilitate seamless online purchases. The app utilizes a service-oriented architecture and is developed following SOLID principles, making it scalable and maintainable.

Key features include secure user authentication, a RESTful API for all operations, and support for CRUD functionalities. The app also provides advanced search capabilities, pagination, sorting, and soft deletes. With Swagger integrated for API documentation and Liquibase for database version control, this application ensures robust error handling and thorough data validation.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The application is structured around a three-layer architecture:

1. **Controller Layer**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and generates responses.
2. **Service Layer**: Contains the business logic and communicates with the repository layer.
3. **Repository Layer**: Responsible for interactions with the database using JPA.

### Core Entities:
- **User**: Contains user profile details and authentication information.
- **Role**: Specifies user roles (e.g., USER, ADMIN).
- **Book**: Represents a book in the catalog.
- **Category**: Organizes books into categories.
- **ShoppingCart**: Manages the items that the user intends to purchase.
- **CartItem**: Represents a single item within the shopping cart.
- **Order**: Contains the details of a placed order.
- **OrderItem**: Represents the books that are part of an order.

## üõ†Ô∏è Working with the .env File

To manage sensitive information and configuration settings, create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. This file will contain environment variables that will be used by the application.

### Example .env File
```env
MYSQLDB_USER=YOUR_USERNAME
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD
MYSQL_DATABASE=bookstore
MYSQLDB_LOCAL_PORT=YOUR_LOCAL_PORT(3307)
MYSQLDB_DOCKER_PORT=MYSQLLOCAL_PORT(3306)

SPRING_LOCAL_PORT=YOUR_HOST_LOCAL_PORT(8081)
SPRING_DOCKER_PORT=HOST_LOCAL_PORT(8080)
DEBUG_PORT=5005
